<span class="pf-box"> 
<img src="./images/drone.svg" class="center"/>
<h3 style="text-align:center"> Drone &amp; UAV Technologies </h3>
<p>
Our expertise in advanced drone development is now taken further with 5G enabled drones having a much greater connectivity and lower latency allowing for a greater precision in manoeuvring and the quick transfer of high-precision data. In particular, the use of 5G as a direct, or back up communication infrastructure, will enable drones to always stay connected.

<span class="pf-box"> 
<img src="./images/vr-glasses.svg" class="center"/>
<h3 style="text-align:center"> AR &amp; VR Technologies</h3>
<p>
Our expertise in iOS and Android based AR/VR technologies is further pummeled with the push of 5G that will make VR and AR a reality for the world. with almost no latency, improved connection, increased traffic capacity, more bandwidth means better screen and equipment quality. For mass adoption of VR and AR tech, 5G will need to be adopted first.

<span class="pf-box"> 
<img src="./images/laptop.svg" class="center"/>
<h3 style="text-align:center"> Smart Healthcare </h3>
<p>
The healthcare industry is moving fast toward a complete digital environment with 5G enabling the Massive Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Breakthrough innovations, such as continuously monitoring of all-vitals of patients through multisensory environments, teleporting doctors to a virtual environment for remote haptic interactions with their patients, performing technology-enabled remote surgeries or leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to explore, compare sensory data and generate new medical insights are all now possible.
</p>

<span class="pf-box"> 
<img src="./images/industry.svg" class="center"/>
<h3 style="text-align:center"> Industry 4.0 </h3>
<p> Adoption of 5G in Industry 4.0 as proposed by 5G-ACIA can enable new operating models for Industrial Automation by leveraging and interconnecting the emergence of cyber-physical systems, advances in component technologies as in IIoT to machine vision, AI, Robotics and Software-driven operating processes all working in tandem can realize the vision of the "factory of the future".
