### What is a Progressive Web Application?

Unreliable network connections are an unavoidable reality on the mobile web. But that doesn't mean they need to disrupt your users. Progressive web apps (PWA) leverage modern web technologies to provide offline support so your app never goes down.

Let janky scrolling and routing delays become a thing of the past. By intelligently caching app content, PWA's create a smooth user experience, no matter how sophisticated your application is. Eliminating navigation issues ensures you maximize user retainment.

## So what are the Best Practices in Web Development ?
#

### Keep Branding Consistent
Website design that lacks consistent branding is stressful and confusing. There are quite a few brand websites out there that are a bit all over the place. It’s difficult to tell what their brand colors are, what their logo looks like, how they are positioning themselves or even what services they offer.



### Create Strong CTAs
Two main goals of a website is to attract a large target market and to tell the customer what you offer. The final goal should always be to entice the visitor to complete an action – whether it is to sign up for a newsletter, download a case study, or set up a consultation. Strong calls to action are essential to converting website visitors into leads or new clients.

### Fast Loading Time
A single second of added page load speed can cause sales to drop by up to 27%. In 2013, the average size of websites grew 32%. Websites are getting bigger, and today’s research suggests that the sweet spot number for load times might be inching closer to two seconds as opposed to the current three seconds. According to recent studies, 47% of visitors expect a website to load in less than 2 seconds, and 40% of visitors will leave the website if the loading process takes more than 3 seconds. 

#### What can companies do to keep page loading times minimal?

Use Static website technologies like GatsbyJS powered by Headless CMS like contentful, Ghost CMS etc. can significantly improve your website performance in terms of loading time and better performance. 

The reasons why Static Website Technology is best especially for static and content websites is as follows:
- Static Websites use technologies like Pre-Rendering and Server Side Rendering SSR) that serves ready to view HTML files and hence this entire process is much faster.
- Data provisioning and data fetching from an external Headless CMS using JSON/REST API makes managing your website content, multimedia and assets much more efficient and separates it from your static website design.
- Latest Fast CDN technologies such as Netlify and Zeit.co use some amazingly fast Cloud Hosting and Fast and Smart CDN technologies that dishes out Static sites at a blazing fast speed.
-  Things like Image Optimizations, Browser Cache Invalidations, SSL Security already with most of these hosting service providers.
 
### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
SEO is used to increase the amount of visitors to your website by obtaining a high-ranking placement in the search engine results page (SERP). It does this through using a single phrase, known as a keyword, that is used throughout compelling and readable content on your site.

For the search engines, it’s essential to include all important on-page SEO tags and elements, including schema and XML sitemaps. Too much technical jargon for you? That’s okay because we specialize in SEO too. Contact a team member if you’d like us to optimize your website or leave us a comment at the bottom of the page, and we’d be happy to answer it.

Once again, Static Website generators such as GatsbyJS are highly tailored for providing a very SEO friendly static website as the Website is already a Server Rendered Website and Google prefers a Server Rendered website high in its SEO ranking considerations.

### Mobile Friendly
You might build a great website that looks good when viewed on a desktop or laptop, but when being displayed on a cell phone or tablet, it becomes very cluttered, unorganized, and hard to navigate. If you’re in this boat, you will lose potential leads. On average, 8 out of 10 consumers will stop engaging with a site if its content doesn’t display properly on their device.

Responsive design adjusts to the size of your browser automatically, making it a lot easier for website users to find all the information they need, stress free. A responsive design serves all devices with the same code that adjusts for every screen size. Mobile devices are projected to reach 79% of global internet use by the end of 2018, a mobile-friendly and responsive website design is essentially becoming a standard these days.

### Easy Navigation

You’ll also want to make sure that your most important pages have the highest accessibility. Let’s consider a few more website design best practices:

- Limit your navigation menu bar to 4-6 options. 88% of websites have their main navigation located in the header at the top of every page, making horizontal top-level navigation a web design standard.
- Search bars are key, especially for sites with lots of content.
- Contact information should be in the right hand corner and easily visible.
- Sticky “back-to-top” buttons allow the viewer to scroll down to their heart’s content and with the click of a button go back to the top without the hassle of manually scrolling all the way back up. Trust us, nobody has time for that.
- Use breadcrumbs to let your visitors know where they are. This is especially true for ecommerce websites since this type of site has tons of product categories and subcategories. This also applies to websites with lots of content. With breadcrumbs, one can easily go back to the previous page or check out a specific category. It acts like the “You are here” sign we see in malls.

### Email Marketing
Although an older form of staying connected, email marketing still plays a major role in keeping customers and potential customers in the loop of your services and content. Past experience has shown us that 77% of executives prefer to receive marketing communications through email rather than other forms of marketing.

Email is relevant, and your email campaigns should be too. A site’s email capture forms should sync with your email marketing system for seamless access and connection. Make sure that your audience doesn’t have to go searching for your email sign-up icon. Placing the icon in the header or footer are both web design best practices you’ll want to consider.

### Social Media
We all know the power behind social media and the different ways we can use our social media outlets to promote brands and drive content. That being said, anywhere you can link your social accounts, you definitely should. This could include (but not limited to) your emails, blog articles, guest posts, other social bios, etc. Did you know that 72% of websites include icons for social media websites in the footer? This alone almost makes this a standard as well as one of our web design best practices that we recommend for the most traffic to your site.

### Quality Photos
According to Hubspot, people can recall up to 65% of information that is visually depicted for a period of 72 hours vs only 10% of information they hear for the same period of time. With 37% of the population being visual learners, featuring high quality photos and logos will help your audience gauge your brand and content more easily.

High-quality images will help convert your online leads by:

- Garnering more views to your site, which means more chances to convert!
- Increasing user engagement, which means users spend more time on your site.
- Decreasing bounce rate, which means more traffic and higher rankings!
- Forming a link between customer and company, which means users are more likely to choose your services.

### Color Scheme & Topography
Your website should embody the personality of your brand, and so should your color scheme as well as your Typography. If your background and text colors don’t provide enough contrast, people will have difficulties reading your content and displeased that your site is not visually appealing. The more visually appealing your site is, the more likely your customers will be able to recall your content.
