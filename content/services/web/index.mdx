### What is a Progressive Web Application?

Unreliable network connections are an unavoidable reality on the mobile web. But that doesn't mean they need to disrupt your users. Progressive web apps (PWA) leverage modern web technologies to provide offline support so your app never goes down.

Let janky scrolling and routing delays become a thing of the past. By intelligently caching app content, PWA's create a smooth user experience, no matter how sophisticated your application is. Eliminating navigation issues ensures you maximize user retainment.

## So what are the Best Practices in FinTech Development ?

The emergence of new and disruptive financial technology is fueling the need for innovation by traditional financial institutions as they attempt to keep pace with demands for better technology-based services. Consumers are demanding more actionable and intuitive user experiences from bank technologies. As a result, the financial services industry is more focused on technology innovation than at any other point in its history.

Data aggregation—the ability to compile and create meaningful data from disparate sources—remains critical to providing innovative digital experiences to consumers. Indeed, modern financial data aggregation goes far beyond its initial beginnings of scraping financial data from screens and even from the structured data feeds that top aggregators use to gather consumer financial data for financial services organizations.

Data aggregation services today require a more comprehensive scope to cover leading practices in the following areas:
- Access to the Best Financial Data Available on a Massive Scale
- Financial Data that is Made to Do More – Data + Intelligence™
- Bank-Level Data Security

### Data Aggregation and Intelligence
#

In recent years, account data aggregation has evolved in response to major industry trends that include: the move to cloud technologies, the emergence of Big Data, user experiences that demand rich real-time data, and the flexibility of open platform models. With the growth in consumer demand for financial guidance from their financial institutions, advisors, and consumer apps, data aggregation has taken on greater importance as a strategic asset.

### Data Aggregation Considerations 

Financial data aggregation is the automatic collection of
personal financial account data from multiple sources,
within and outside the financial institutions, into a single
resource. Data is compiled from different accounts that
often include bank, credit card, and investment accounts,
as well as other consumer or business accounts.

### Data Intelligence Opportunities

Big Data, however, generally refers to a set of technologies that manage massive data sets—like the data that comes from financial aggregation. The most interesting trends in the area now involve how organizations can use the wealth of data that is available to drive decisions, support product development, and identify customer needs.

These goals go beyond data reporting and enter the realm of data intelligence, a data science discipline in its own right. “Data intelligence has a slightly different philosophy (than big data) that embraces some of the messy and unstructured nature of the world that we do live in,” says Sean Gourley, Co-Founder and CTO, Quid, a data intelligence firm.2

Data intelligence helps improve processes and results, according to a survey by the Association of Financial Professionals.3 According to more than half of all respondents and some 80 percent of respondents
at organizations with successful data intelligence programs in place, data intelligence provides the following benefits:
- Accuracy of analysis
- Ability to identify relevant and available data sources
- Ability to reach actionable conclusions from analysis

Data intelligence leverages data science to give big data its power. The real worth of data aggregation lies in the ability to tap the insights that lie in the underlying data. Assuming high-quality data, data intelligence provides an analytics layer on top of the aggregation platform that enables pattern and insight recognition and can help:
- Anticipate consumer financial needs
- Provide customers with ability to create a uniquely personalized user experience
- Predict future activity along with simple, actionable guidance

### Security Risk Assessments 

Protecting personal information of individuals who use our customers’ products and services must be a top priority for any data aggregation service. The heightened awareness of security breaches in the financial system only heightens the need for a complete and thorough review of the security standards followed by any third party that handles financial data.


### The Innovative Imperative

Innovation is not generally considered a strength of financial institutions. For traditional financial institutions to build on their competitive advantage and regain the profits they have enjoyed in the past, however, innovation must become a best practice in financial services.
It’s no surprise that large, traditional banking and other financial services firms have largely avoided serious innovation for decades. From disparate data silos to archaic back-end software platforms, the financial services industry is working with systems that, in some cases, have been functioning for decades. Any major change is risky to existing customer operations.

Today, there are hundreds of new FinTech entrants, born in the digital age, that have accelerated the delivery of smarter and more personalized financial solutions that are often faster, and easier to use. Building anew is much easier than renovating outdated service platforms. As a result, disruptive FinTech innovation tends to occur in newer and more nimble financial service firms.
