> The concept of human mobility is being engineered in alignment with the human experience.

Our Innovation in Connected Car and Autonomous technologies is driven by a solid confluence of maturing of technologies in the areas of sensors, in-car and on-board digital diagnostics, internet of things, machine-to-machine, artificial intelligence, highly precisee mapping and navigation and finally by the cloud computing technologies. All these technologies have influenced heavily in building the car of the future, which is electric, completely digital in nature and autonomous in many cases.

> 5G NR – standalone or SA – mode rollout, which promises lower latencies, will be critical for creating an inflection point in the commercialisation of autonomous cars later in the next decade
