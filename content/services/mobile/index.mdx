Backend development for Mobile is the critical piece of your mobile application functionality as it is the brain of your application powered by data that is processed in the backend engine and sent via API to the mobile application over the Internet. All the user data, the database, the server or <strong> serverless processing, authentication, data dashboards, security </strong> and the content store, it all takes place at the backend. Technovature's deep expertise in chosing the right backend for your mobile application's need ensures a solid long-term architecture and a dependable framework for a proper functioning of your mobile application.

### Explosive Mobile Growth 

> By 2020, there will be 6.95 billion mobile users across the world. Mobile devices generate nearly fifty percent of the global website traffic. The future is all about the next generation, Generation Z (ages 16-24) of mobile users.

## So what are the Best Practices in building a Mobile App?


### Significance of Mobile app design
Mobile app design is the most important and stage I factor in developing a mobile app. The optimization needs a comprehensive approach and the ability to look beyond the traditional principles. The investment over the user experience opens up a great opportunity for an app and saves the unnecessary cost of resources, money and time.

### Keep options as minimum as possible 

The mobile phone screen is not enough big to accommodate multiple options. Few additional components can overwhelm the users. By dividing options into multiple screens is always recommendable for better readability. The comprehensive way of designing the mobile app is bifurcate the process and then render into multiple screens. Splitting the options into multiple screens eases them to determine what exactly they wish to choose.


### Accessible Content 

The app screen should not be loaded with a load of content, especially when it is hard to be found with slow navigation. Even if you hire an app developer for your mobile app, you must keep in mind that navigation in an app must be simple and intuitive, properly arranged with the recognizable components. When a user shifts from one screen to another, it becomes easy for him to take action.


### Stick to the ecosystem standards 

Both the Mobile OS platforms Android and iOS have some predefined guidelines for the apps running over them. Following these guidelines ensures for the developer a hassle-free and safe path for the app. Android and iOS both make 98 percent of the market share, therefore they are more concerned about user experience on their platforms while leveraging their guidelines than the developer who is merely concerned with the success of an app. The foremost important thing for a developer is to follow the recommendations listed in Google Material Design for Android developers and iOS Human Interface guidelines for iOS developers by Apple.

### Device compatibility

Two decades ago, Personal computer was the only choice user used to have for the tasks. Now the tables are entirely changed. They are enjoying multiple options to choose from for the same task. At one time, they work over Smartphone, next, they will switch to tablet or will choose the laptop, whichever they wish. This necessitates a software development company to render a perfect UX design for whatever device the user chooses. The seamless experience of the app increases the usage of the app, which is a more important factor than the number of downloads.

### Content Clarity

Often, designers confront the issue of showing up much content into a single screen. This makes the content unreadable and loses credibility. Alongside, increasing the font size of changes the alignment and distancing between words and paragraphs. Each element on the smartphone screen must be comprehensible and functional.

### Use Color Schemes
Often the colors can be used to demarcate the functional element and the regular content. Using the whitespace skillfully can boost up the UX of the app. Also, designers can practice the clever use of dynamic color modifications based over the actions of the users.

### Make navigation better

To keep users stuck to your app, navigation must be smooth. Navigation allows swiping your app easily and enhancing the user experience.

### Listen to users

User’s feedbacks are a great source of market research. User reviews give you an idea about the probable bugs and other influential factors of app success. User may also support the features they wish to see in-app.

### Test with different audience

Often the developers and the team are obsessed with the target audience. Not considering the audience who do not have tech experience leaves much crucial information untouched.

Competitive research: Doing some research over the successful apps tell what works and whatnot.

### Keep the Design Simple

Addition of the unnecessary features often disrupts the design. It looks awkward to the users. Keeping the minimalistic design approach makes the element comprehensible.

Incorporate interactive design: Incorporating interactive designs attracts users and make users fall in love with your app. With the interactive designs in the app, the designer makes web interfaces more attractive.
