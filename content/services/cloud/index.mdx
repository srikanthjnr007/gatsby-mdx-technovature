### What is a Hybrid Cloud?

> *Hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment that uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud and third-party, public cloud services with orchestration between the two platforms.*

### Cloud Statistics

> *The public cloud service market is expected to reach $623.3 billion by 2023 worldwide.
While 83% of enterprise workloads will be in the cloud by 2020.*

> The #1 priority in 2020 is cloud cost optimization

## So what are the Best Practices in Cloud Computing ?


There is a set of problematic issues that pose a significant threat to cloud users, such as:

- The degree of trust to the cloud service provider;
- Ensuring confidentiality, integrity, relevance, and incontrovertibility of information at all levels;
- Loss of data control and data leaks;
- Protection against unauthorized access;
- Malicious insiders;
- Saving personal data of users transmitted and processed in the cloud.

#### Security Breach
> *In November 2018, Marriott International announced that cyber thieves stole data on **500 million customers**. The attackers‚Äô targets were contact info, passport number, Starwood Preferred Guest numbers, travel information, credit card numbers and expiration dates of more than **100 million customers.** *

The cloud computing system can be exposed to several types of security threats, which can be divided into the following groups:

- Threats to the integrity;
- Threats to confidentiality;
- Accessibility risks;
- Authorization risks;
- Browser vulnerabilities.


Some key best practices in implementing cloud security in your organizaion are as below:

- **Train Staff** üí∞
  The users are the front line against threats to secure cloud computing. These users are staff and stakeholders of the company that utilizes the cloud computing network to access different functions through different touchpoints. These users should be well trained in spotting dangerous elements such as malware masquerading as legitimate applications or files.
- **Look for trustworthy cloud security providers** üí™
  In a digital age of transparency and lightning-fast connections, privacy has become a serious concern. A breach in data such as a leak of customer personal information to hackers can result in costly lawsuits and compensations. Therefore, it is paramount that cloud cybersecurity providers are up to the task and understand the regulations surrounding cloud network security. These providers of security cloud services should provide documentation and reports on the process and status of the cloud network‚Äôs security.
- ** Look into the future ** üôå
  The internet is a rapidly growing place with new innovations being made. These innovations have led to the creation of more complicated and capable cloud cybersecurity threats. With the rapidly evolving risk, cloud computing security must look into the future and prepare for potential threats that the cloud network security might face. As such, cloud security should be regularly updated. This goes for both the software and the polices involved. The software needs to be able to fend off the threat while policy updates keep the process compliance with the latest industry standards.
- **Encryption cloud-based security** üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  For cloud computing to be secure, the data should be encrypted as it enters the cloud storage device. Moreover, in creating a secure cloud computing system, users should be able to send encrypted data to and from the network. It protects the confidentiality of data being transmitted. Also, it limits the level of access each user has within the cloud computing network.
- **Deploying Cloud Security Management solutions** üë´
  A tactical cloud computing security best practice would be to implement identity and access management solutions to the cloud computing network. This process involves stopping threats from the user‚Äôs endpoint as its purpose is to screen the entities accessing the cloud computing network from a designated access point.
- **Secure Endpoints** üë´
  Securing endpoints is a good practice for cloud computing security as it provides intrusion protection and access control. Endpoint security and cloud computing security used to be separated disciplines. However, changes in consumer behavior have led companies to adopt more open, affordable and accessible IT solutions for cloud computing. By integrating cloud computing security with the endpoints, companies are able to meet the round the clock demands of its customer base.
- **Neutralize and removal of threats from cloud security** üë´
  One of the best cloud computing best practices is improving the speed of neutralization and removal of cyber threats. Cloud cybersecurity threats have become increasingly advanced. They are able to disguise themselves as innocently appearing resumes, invoices, and other common documents.
- **Intrusion protection and prevention** üë´
  An intrusion protection and prevention system examines the files moving through the network to identify and prevent vulnerabilities that can be exploited. An intruder usually finds a way into the cloud computing network through input from an endpoint. The aim of such an intrusion is to interrupt the network and gain control of applications.
- **Compliance Requirement ** üë´
  Implementation of a cloud cybersecurity that meets the regulations of both the industry and governments has become a must as stakeholders are becoming increasingly connected in a rapidly globalized world. While compliance might seem intuitive, the process is made complex. This is because data and applications move from a controlled environment to endpoints in different countries, jurisdiction and regulations.
  The speed of communication and ease of use has given a sweet spot for chatbots in the Millennial audience compared to legacy tools.
- **Conduct cloud security IT audits** üë´
  These cloud computing security audits are performed to determine if the network and its maintainers meet the legal expectations of customer data protection and the company‚Äôs standards for facing cloud cybersecurity threats. These audits should be transparent, cover the relevant scope and consider locational jurisdictions.
